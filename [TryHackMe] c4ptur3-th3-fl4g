A beginner level CTF challenge

# Introduction
There are a total of 4 tasks in this CTF challenge, the 1st task covering ciphers, encoding, and encryption. Usage of Base64 and rotational ciphers is highly prevalent. 
Task 2 involves messages hidden in spectrograms of audio files. Task 3 involves steganography, particularly image steganography. Task 4 involves other forms of steganography 
and hiding messages in files, utilizing the practise of security through obscurity. Both tasks provide decent challenges for a novice. The length of this CTF is around 45 minutes,
according to the TryHackMe website. 
Its a simple, yet engaging challenge, especially for someone who has never attempted one before, like me. Finding numerous toolchains, expliots, ciphers, vulnerabilities, as well as
analysing files closely, going as far as looking at the binary data, the headers, and many more. This CTF was a perfect introduction for me to OSINT, decoding ciphers, steganography, and 
other offensive security practises. Overall, a perfect beginner challenge for students in cybersecuirty, looking to pursue the world of CTFs.
This tutorial aims to document the solutions for this CTF. No form of AI or deep learning was used to find these solutions, or create this write-up.
